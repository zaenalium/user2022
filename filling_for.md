# Abstract

Credit scoring is a most common case in machine learning. However, until now the reference is still limited. We know that there are books that written about it, but it intended to SAS user. On the internet there also a reference but it mainly covers the machine learning part. As a person who involved in credit bureau industry, the problem was not just machine learning. The are many problems that are not covered in reference such as matching identity, data preparation with snapshot, deploy the model, etc. Thus, in this tutorial I would like to discuss about the end-to-end credit scoring modeling from data gathering until the model deployment.

# Intended audience

This tutorial is intended to new R users, advanced R user also welcome to join if they would like to know more detail about credit scoring.
The prerequisites is of course knowing R and at least familiar using dplyr or data.table.
